   # write a difference between let, const and var with code examples



	1. Difference between let and var:
			a) A var variable can be redeclared and updated.
			b) A let variable be be updated but not redeclared.
		
code for let:
			An example of trying to redeclare a let variable:
			// In editor:
			<script>
			let points = 50;
			let points = 60;
			</script>


code for var:


		let points = 50;
		var winner = false;
			if(points > 40) {
 				 var winner = true;
			}
	// If I call:
		winner
	// It now returns: 
		true



			2.  Difference between let and const:

						const variables cannot be updated. let variables are made to be updated.


code for const:

 		// Creating my person object:
			const person = {
 			 name: 'Joseph',
 			 age: 33
			}
		// Calling person in the console:
				person
		// It returns:
			{name: "Joseph", age: 33}
		// If I then redeclare the age attribute:
			person.age = 34
		// When I call it:
			person
		// It returns:
			{name: "Joseph", age: 34}
